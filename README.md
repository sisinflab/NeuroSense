## Overview

### EEG Emotion Recognition - Muse Headset
#### 2023-2024

The experiment consists in 40 sessions per user. During each session, users are asked to watch a
music video with the aim to understand their emotions.  
Recordings are performed with a Muse EEG headset at a 256 Hz sampling rate.  
Channels are recorded as follows:
- Channel 0: AF7
- Channel 1: TP9
- Channel 2: TP10
- Channel 3: AF8

The chosen songs have various Last.fm tags in order to create different feelings. The title of every track
can be found in the "TaskName" field of sub-ID***_ses-S***_task-Default_run-001_eeg.json, while the author,
the Last.fm tag and additional information in "TaskDescription".

## Methods

### Subjects

The subject pool is made of 30 college students, aged between 18 and 35. 16 of them are males, 14 females.

### Apparatus

The experiment was performed using the same procedures as those to create
[Deap Dataset](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/), which is a dataset to recognize emotions via a Brain
Computer Interface (BCI).  


### Task organization

Firstly, music videos were selected. Once 40 songs were picked, the protocol was chosen and the self-assessment
questionnaire was created.

### Task details

In order to evaluate the stimulus, Russell's VAD (Valence-Arousal-Dominance) scale was used.  
In this scale, valenza-arousal space can be divided in four quadrants:
- Low Arousal/Low Valence (LALV);
- Low Arousal/High Valence (LAHV);
- High Arousal/Low Valence (HALV);
- High Arousal/High Valence (HAHV).

### Experimental location

The experiment was performed in a laboratory located at DEI Department of
[Politecnico di Bari](https://www.poliba.it/).

### Missing data
Data recorded during session S019 - Session 2, ID021 - Session 23,  user was corrupted, therefore is missing.  
Sessions S033 and S038 of ID015 user show a calculated effective sampling rate lower than 256 Hz:
- ID015_ses-S033 has 226.1320 Hz
- ID015_ses-S038 has 216.9549 Hz
