### 1. Introduction

The **NeuroSense** dataset is a collection of electroencephalography (EEG) signals gathered using the portable Muse 2 device with 4 sparse electrodes. This dataset aims to facilitate 
research in emotion recognition, human-computer interaction, mental health monitoring, and related fields. By accessing the NeuroSense dataset, users agree to comply with the terms outlined in this Data Use Agreement (DUA).

### 2. Prohibited Use of EEG Data

**a. Re-identification and Participant Privacy**

- Users are strictly prohibited from attempting to re-identify participants through the NeuroSense EEG data. This includes, but is not limited to, combining NeuroSense data with other datasets or external information that could potentially be used to identify individual participants.
- Users must ensure that EEG data is used solely for the purposes outlined in this agreement and not for any activities that could compromise the anonymity or privacy of the participants.

**b. Data Security and Handling**

- Users must implement appropriate security measures to protect the NeuroSense EEG data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
- EEG data should be stored securely, and access should be limited to authorized personnel involved in the approved research activities.

**c. Prohibited Derivative Works**

- Users are prohibited from creating or using derivative works derived from the NeuroSense EEG data that could potentially reveal identifiable information about participants.
- This includes transforming or analyzing the EEG data in ways that might lead to the extraction of sensitive information or patterns unique to individual participants.

**d. No Distribution or Sharing**

- Users must not distribute, share, or otherwise make the NeuroSense EEG data available to third parties unless explicitly authorized under this agreement.
- Any sharing of data within a research team must ensure that all team members are aware of and comply with the terms of this Data Use Agreement.

**e. Ethical Use of Data**

- Users must adhere to all applicable laws, regulations, and ethical guidelines governing the use of EEG data in research.
- Any use of the EEG data outside the scope of this agreement requires prior written consent from the NeuroSense administrative team.

### 3. Privacy and Confidentiality

**a. Non-Identification**

- Users will not use the NeuroSense dataset, either alone or in combination with other data, to identify or contact individuals who participated in the data collection.
- If a user inadvertently obtains identifiable information or identifies a participant, they must promptly notify the NeuroSense administrators and follow their written instructions, which may include returning or destroying the identifiable information.

### 4. Data Access and Disclosure

**a. Permitted Use**

- The NeuroSense dataset is to be used solely for research purposes as outlined in the study description. Any other use is prohibited unless explicitly authorized.

**b. Prohibited Use**

- Users will not use or further disclose the NeuroSense dataset beyond the permissions granted in this agreement.
- Users will not create or disseminate derivative works or data that could be used to reconstruct identifiable information about participants.

**c. Reporting Unauthorized Use**

- Users must report any unauthorized use or disclosure of the NeuroSense dataset promptly. The report should include:
    1. The nature of the unauthorized use or disclosure.
    2. The specific information that was used or disclosed.
    3. The identities of the individuals or entities responsible.
    4. Corrective actions taken to mitigate the impact.

**d. Mitigation Efforts**

- Users must take all reasonable actions to mitigate any detrimental effects resulting from unauthorized use or disclosure.

### 5. Acknowledgment and Citation

**a. Acknowledgment in Publications and Presentations**

- When publicly presenting results, algorithms, or findings derived from the NeuroSense dataset, users must acknowledge the use of NeuroSense data as follows:
    
    **Acknowledgments Section:**
    
    "Data were provided [in part] by the NeuroSense dataset.
    

**b. Citation Requirements**

- Users must cite the NeuroSense dataset appropriately in all publications and presentations. Please use the following citation format:
    
    **Reference Citation:**
